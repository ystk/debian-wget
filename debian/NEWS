  Subject: CVE-2014-4877: Arbitrary Symlink Access
  
  Wget was susceptible to a symlink attack which could create arbitrary
  files, directories or symbolic links and set their permissions when
  retrieving a directory recursively through FTP. This commit changes the
  default settings in Wget such that Wget no longer creates local symbolic
  links, but rather traverses them and retrieves the pointed-to file in
  such a retrieval.
  
  The old behaviour can be attained by passing the --retr-symlinks=no
  option to the Wget invokation command.
